This repository provides the data, scripts, and figures for René's project tracking genetic diversity loss in three fish species from Hamilo Cove (*Atherinomorous endrachtensis*, *Gazza minuta*, and *Equulites laterofenestra*).

A pending list of all necessary software and packages (with version numbers) can be found at the bottom of this README.

This repository is organized into 3 folders:
1. **Data:** Contains source data for R scripts, filtered VCF files, and metadata. Organized by species.
2. **Plots:** Contains pngs of plots.
3. **Scripts:** Contains R scripts and code for analyses.

*A record of the bioinformatics pipeline (from raw reads to filtered VCF files) for each species can be found in the relevant directory in the **philippinespire/pire_cssl_data_processing** directory.* 

Please contact René at rclark848[at]gmail.com with any questions.

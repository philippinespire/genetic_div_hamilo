 * **He_Perc_Change_Plot.png:** Plot of the mean % change in He over time for *Gazza minuta*, *Equulites laterofenestra* and a range of other species (data from [Leigh et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12810)). Positive values indicate an increase over time, negative values indicate a decrease. Grey box surrounds fish taxa; grey diamonds represent mean % change/taxonomic group.
